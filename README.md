## Data Recovery

This project was created to preserve and provide access to PDEP data after the original clres.com domain seems to have been completely taken over by some casino gambling site. The data was recovered from:

- Internet Archive (Wayback Machine) snapshots of clres.com
- MySQL database dumps preserved in a GitHub repository I found (https://github.com/lgessler/bert-has-uncommon-sense)

All data is made available under the original GPL license.
